The space has since been transformed into a dramatic 2 bedroom/ with library and 2 full baths. The architectural brief was to create larger bedrooms and a grander entertaining space which would house an established art collection. A notable feature of this loft would be its horizontal floor plan which stretches across the west side of building's east tower. 17-O is suspended above the courtyard and away from the street so there is a sense of peacefulness and calm. Only four O-line apartments were built by the developer and 17O is positioned on the highest floor just below the penthouse. Panoramic views of West Chelsea is itself a framed, picture-perfect moment in each room.<br><br>A clever decision to clad the entire expanse of the eastern elevation in wood paneling was implemented. Imported Italian Birdseye maple would be selected for floor-to-ceiling paneling and matching doors. The kitchen, also located on the eastern elevation, was custom built in the same species of wood. The overall effect is that of cohesion, balance and elegant modernity. The lighting is purposeful and there is a fully equipped audio system. What was once a powder room is now a large laundry with storage and wine cabinet.

Why settle for an ordinary alcove studio when you can own this custom-designed jewel box with a real terrace? A clever renovation has created three distinct rooms here, with an ingenious hidden door that allows for complete privacy in the sleeping area while preserving the ample floor space. You must see this unique and luxurious home!
The apartment faces west over quiet Washington Street, its broad terrace spanning the unit's width. Indulge your green thumb, and youll enjoy the view of plants and flowers from the living room window and the desk via the tall door.
 Sectioned into discrete seating, viewing, eating, and study/work areas, the main living space is highly functional. It has a cool color palette and elegant lighting. Built-in storage abounds!
 The closets offer California-style treatments, and the apartment is fully wired with the latest smart home technology, including Lutron lighting controls, Philip Hue smart lights, motorized black-out shades, two-zoned heating/cooling and Nest thermostats. 
The wide-plank floors throughout are a cool, dark neutral.
The stylish and highly functional kitchen features sleek black countertops, handsome walnut cabinets lining the walls, a black glass backsplash matching the countertops, and appliances including a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Fisher & Paykel double-drawer dishwashers, and a Viking range.
Clad in pale marble, the bath features a dark lava stone floor, a tropical rain shower head, and a Kohler soaking tub. It also has an elegant wood vanity, warm lighting, and pretty glass shelving for storage or display.
Alcove studios can be tricky when it comes to privacy in the sleeping area, but the designer here has found an ingenious solution: a heavy, floor-to-celling door, which disappears into the wall when open, closes off the entire alcove, transforming it into a quiet sanctuary. Lined with drawers and cupboards, youll not need a dresser. A Murphy concept from Resource Furniture is a bed by night and a sofa by day, providing the flexibility that is so welcome in a city apartment!
Residents at the Greenwich Club have exclusive access to premium amenities: state-of-the-art gym, which is continually upgraded; the library with its grand piano and wall of books, billiards, and media room; 24-hour doorman, valet service for housekeeping, dry-cleaning/tailoring, and packages. The buildings lounge, the Harbor Room on the 24th floor, has a full kitchen, cable TV, and stunning views of the Hudson, NY harbor and the Downtown skyline. The Harbor Room is available to owners to reserve for private events. All the common spaces are Wi-Fi enabled, and residents have an on-site business center and cold storage. There is a laundry room on every floor.
The West FiDi location is ideal for access to the Hudson River Parks and Seaport Attractions and is just two blocks from major subway express and PATH trains. Bountiful shopping options abound: Oculus Mall, The Fulton Transportation Center, Eataly, and Whole Foods are just 1 block away.

Throughout the 6th, 7th, and 8th floors, residents have exclusive access to 22,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor health, wellness, social, and entertainment amenity spaces. These amenities, together with an extensive range of concierge and lifestyle services, offer residents an experience found only in world-class hotels and resorts. On the southern side of the 6th floor the first of the building's two terraces is outfitted with grills, cafe seating, and dining cabanas with picnic tables. From this terrace residents will enjoy stunning views of Cass Gilbert's classic Woolworth building. The adjacent game room is outfitted with custom designed seating by Gehry. On the 7th floor a 50-foot pool is set within a skylit space surrounded by a series of glass doors that retract fully, creating a seamless integration with the building's wraparound sundeck. Overlooking City Hall Park to the north, a large drawing room with multiple seating areas and a grand piano is located adjacent to a private dining room. Both are available for private events that can be served from a chef's demonstration and catering kitchen. A 3,300 square foot state-of-the-art fitness center with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge and a spa treatment suite are also located on the 7th floor.

Apartment Features: Gehry's design resulted in over 200 unique floor plans that bring the drama of the dynamic exterior wall movement into residents' private spaces. In the places where the facade undulates, the residential windows also move out into space into the apex of the folds creating free-form bay windows that are fitted with seating or left open to accommodate uniquely shaped dining or reading niches. All interior finishes and fixtures have been selected by Gehry, including cabinetry crafted in his signature honey-colored vertical grain Douglas Fir.

Why settle for an ordinary alcove studio when you can own this custom-designed jewel box with a real terrace! A clever renovation has created three distinct rooms here, with an ingenious hidden door that allows for complete privacy in the sleeping area while preserving the ample floor space. You must see this unique and luxurious home!
The apartment faces west over quiet Washington Street, its broad terrace spanning the unit's width. Indulge your green thumb, and you'll enjoy the view of plants and flowers from the living room window and the desk via the tall door.
Sectioned into discrete seating, viewing, eating, and study/work areas, the main living space is highly functional. It has a cool color palette and elegant lighting. Built-in storage abounds!
The closets offer California-style treatments, and the apartment is fully wired with the latest smart home technology, including Lutron lighting controls, Philip Hue smart lights, motorized black-out shades, two-zoned heating/cooling and Nest thermostats.
The wide-plank floors throughout are a cool, dark neutral.
The stylish and highly functional kitchen features sleek black countertops, handsome walnut cabinets lining the walls, a black glass backsplash matching the countertops, and appliances including a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Fisher & Paykel double-drawer dishwashers, and a Viking range.
Clad in pale marble, the bath features a dark lava stone floor, a tropical rain shower head, and a Kohler soaking tub. It also has an elegant wood vanity, warm lighting, and pretty glass shelving for storage or display.
Alcove studios can be tricky when it comes to privacy in the sleeping area, but the designer here has found an ingenious solution: a heavy, floor-to-celling door, which disappears into the wall when open, closes off the entire alcove, transforming it into a quiet sanctuary. Lined with drawers and cupboards, you'll not need a dresser. A Murphy concept from Resource Furniture is a bed by night and a sofa by day, providing the flexibility that is so welcome in a city apartment!
Residents at the Greenwich Club have exclusive access to premium amenities: state-of-the-art gym, which is continually upgraded; the library - with its grand piano and wall of books, billiards, and media room; 24-hour doorman, valet service for housekeeping, dry-cleaning/tailoring, and packages.

The Harbor Room is available to owners to reserve for private events. All the common spaces are Wi-Fi enabled, and residents have an on-site business center and cold storage.
